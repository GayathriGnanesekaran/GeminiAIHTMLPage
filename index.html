    <p>Google recently unveiled Gemini AI, its latest large language model, designed to be more powerful and capable than its predecessor. The new LLM comes in three sizes: Nano, Pro, and Ultra, catering to various needs of the users. Nano has been developed for fast on-device tasks, Pro serves as a versatile middle-tier, and Ultra is the most powerful. However, it is still undergoing safety checks and will be available next year.</p>

    <h2>Google Gemini in Bard</h2>
    <p>According to Google, the integration of Gemini with Google's chatbot Bard brings a significant improvement in user interaction. Gemini's advanced capabilities allow Bard to better understand user intent, leading to more accurate and high-quality responses. Additionally, Gemini's multimodal processing prowess, enables Bard to seamlessly handle images, audio, and video alongside text, creating a more natural and engaging user experience. This integration paves the way for a future of rich and nuanced interactions between humans and AI.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate the multi-modal prowess, Google released a demo to showcase how Gemini cannot only understand direct prompts but also understand the underlying meaning and purpose of certain actions. The video begins with Gemini identifying a piece of paper and a squiggly line drawn on it. It then correctly identifies a blue duck and a rubber duck, demonstrating its ability to recognise objects in both real life and image</p>
